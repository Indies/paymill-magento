To install the extension merge the contents of this cloned repository with your Magento installation.

# Configuration

Afterwards go to System > Configuration > Payment Methods and configure the Paymill payment methods you intend to use by inserting your Paymill test or live keys in the Paymill Basic Settings.

# In case of errors

In case of any errors turn on the debug mode and logging in the Paymill Basic Settings. Open the javascript console in your browser and check what's being logged during the checkout process. To access the logged information not printed in the console please refer to the Paymill Log in the admin backend.

# Notes about the payment process

The payment is processed when an order is placed in the shop frontend.
An invoice is being generated automatically.

There are several options altering this process:

Fast Checkout: Fast checkout can be enabled by selecting the option in the Paymill Basic Settings. If any customer completes a purchase while the option is active this customer will not be asked for data again. Instead a reference to the customer data will be saved allowing comfort during checkout.

Preauthorization and manual capture: If the option is selected, a preauthorization will be generated during checkout. On generation of the invoice, the capture will be triggered automatically, allowing easy capturing without the need to trigger it manually.
